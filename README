Solves the SameGame for Psion by Jon Read

I wanted to write a simple script that would understand
the SameGame, (and all the others that came after that).
To begin with I planned to write a bruteforce solver
that simple walks all of the paths, and then find ways
to optimise it.

This is just a hoby-script, so the code isn't perfect
but it should be fairly clear what each part does.
