take input of a puzzle
  check for exising solution
  create colout map if needed
check for number of solutions required and exiting number
	if($number_of_solutions >= $required_solutions){ last LOOP;}
LOOP: 
Create lock || sleep
add outcome if found
read solution hash
check for number of solutions required and exiting number
	if($number_of_solutions >= $required_solutions){ last LOOP;}
check offset
find next branch
mark branch with #$$ . time
write sol
remove lock
find clickable
